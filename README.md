# heart-disease-project

This project aims to investigate the relationship certain factors have with heart disease. I then intend to train a model to predict whether a person has heart disease or not based on their physical records.

In the data the target variable indicates whether a person has been diagnosed with heart disease. The obervation 1 in the target variable indicates a positive result and 0 represents a negative result for heart disease.
